# Express.js Multi-Page Site Demo

An Express.js app that uses a very simple example of Express page routing.

Inspired by the [Basic Informational Site assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/basic-informational-site) as part of the curriculum for the [NodeJS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
